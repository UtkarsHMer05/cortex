> **The AI-First Customer Support OS.**
> Bridge the gap between automated intelligence and human connection with a unified, real-time support platform.

**Cortex** is a production-grade, full-stack customer support platform that seamlessly blends **Voice AI**, **RAG-powered Chatbots**, and **Human Agents** into a single, cohesive workflow. Built on a modern, type-safe monorepo, it uses **Convex** for real-time state synchronization, **Vapi** for voice synthesis, and **Google Gemini** for intelligent reasoning.

### 🧠 The Neural Core (AI Agent)
Cortex implements a sophisticated **Agentic Workflow** using `@convex-dev/agent` and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model.
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Automatically chunks, embeds, and indexes your uploaded PDFs/text files using **Google's `gemini-embedding-001`** model.
- **Tool Use**: The AI agent is equipped with specific tools:
  - `searchTool`: Queries the vector database for answers.
  - `escalateConversationTool`: Recognizes frustration or complexity and hands off to a human.
- **Context Preservation**: The agent maintains full conversation history across sessions.

### � Knowledge Base & AI Training
Train your AI assistant on your own data in seconds.
1. **Upload Documents**: Go to the **Knowledge Base** tab and upload PDF, TXT, or Markdown files.
2. **Auto-Ingestion**: Cortex automatically extracts text, chunks it into manageable pieces, and generates vector embeddings.
3. **Instant Recall**: The AI immediately has access to this new information and cites it when answering customer queries.

### �🗣️ Real-Time Voice Engine
Offer your customers a "talk-to-support" experience directly in the browser.
- **Vapi Integration**: High-fidelity, low-latency voice AI that feels natural.
- **Server-Side Secret Management**: Vapi API keys are stored securely in the backend, not exposed to the client.
- **Transcript Synchronization**: When a call ends or escalates, the **entire voice transcript** is instantly synced to the agent's dashboard so they have full context.

### 🔌 Easy Integration
Deploy the Cortex widget to any website with a single snippet.
- **Universal Script**: Works with HTML, Next.js, React, or any other framework.
- **Copy & Paste**: Generates a pre-configured script with your unique `Organization ID`.

```html
<!-- Example Setup -->
<script 
  src="https://cortex-widget-utk.vercel.app/widget.js" 
  data-organization-id="your-org-id-here"
></script>
```

### ⚡ Reactive Dashboard (Unified Inbox)
A power-packed command center for your support team, built with **Next.js 15** and **Shadcn UI**.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Incoming messages, status changes, and assignments happen in real-time via **Convex Subscriptions**. No page refreshes needed.
- **Human Handoff**: Agents can "Accept" escalated conversations, taking over control from the AI instantly.
- **Customer Context**: Automatically captures and displays user metadata (Location, Timezone, Device, Browser) alongside the chat.

### 🧩 Embeddable Widget
A standalone, high-performance React widget that can be added to any website.
- **Optimistic UI**: Messages appear instantly using **Jotai** for local state management.
- **Customizable**: Change the greeting, primary colors, and behavior via the Admin Dashboard.

### 🛡️ Enterprise Security & Infrastructure
- **Authentication**: Powered by **Clerk** with support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Strict data access policies ensure organizations can only access their own data.
- **Bank-Grade Secret Management**: All third-party API keys (Vapi, Gemini, etc.) are stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**, never in the codebase or client-side bundles.
- **Subscription Management**: Automated webhook handling for subscription status changes (Active/Past Due).

## 🏗️ Architecture

Cortex is built as a highly modular **Turborepo** monorepo, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Upgrade

We chose the bleeding edge of web technology for maximum performance and developer experience.

| Category | Technology | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Framework** | [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) | Best-in-class React framework with Server Actions. |
| **Database** | [Convex](https://convex.dev/) | Real-time by default. Replaces the need for a separate backend + WebSocket server. |
| **AI Model** | [Gemini 2.5 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) | Superior speed and reasoning for real-time chat. |
| **Voice** | [Vapi](https://vapi.ai/) | The best API for handling WebRTC and voice activity detection. |
| **State** | [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) | Atomic state management for the complex widget UI. Prevents re-render hell. |
| **Styling** | [TailwindCSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) | rapid UI development with a custom design system. |
